## Work in progress..

# aggregate
    
The purpose is to do bulk read/write of nested datastructures from several SQL databases with same schema. Load the data from one database and work on it like a project and then save it back to same database or another SQL database. Of course, the other database must have the same schema.
    
It should allow for matching rows between databases based on some unique constraint rather than just the ID column. This is because, the ID is auto-generated and can go out of sync between databases dependending on usage.

It should allow for renaming the columns to more convinient keywords using a simple schema. Often, the database column names are too long and with underscores. With renaming, it will be much convinient to use :active? in place of "IS_ACTIVE" or just :name in place of "EMPLOYEE_NAME".

Currently testing with h2 and oracle database.
